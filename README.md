## AI Literacy Courses

This repository hosts a growing collection of AI literacy materials designed to make artificial intelligence approachable for learners of all backgrounds. The goal is to demystify core concepts, explain how AI systems work, and provide hands-on activities that build both technical understanding and critical awareness.

📚 What You'll Find Here

Introductory lessons on AI concepts (machine learning, neural networks, data ethics).

Coding exercises that reinforce data structures and algorithms used in AI.

Guided projects that show how real-world AI applications are built.

Discussion prompts to encourage reflection on the impact of AI in society.

🎯 Who Is This For?

These courses are designed for students, professionals, and lifelong learners who want to:

Understand AI beyond the buzzwords.

Build foundational coding and data skills.

Critically evaluate how AI shapes technology and society.

🚧 Work in Progress

This project is in its early stages. Content will be released in modules, starting with:

Foundations of AI – What AI is (and isn’t).

Working with Data – From raw inputs to structured knowledge.

Neural Networks – Building blocks of modern AI.
